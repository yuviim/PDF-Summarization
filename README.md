PDF Summarizer
This project leverages LangChain, FAISS, and OpenAI's GPT-3.5 to extract and summarize the content of PDF files. The summarization process involves extracting text from the uploaded PDF, splitting it into smaller chunks, embedding the chunks, and then using a language model to generate a concise summary.

Features
PDF Text Extraction: Extracts text from PDF documents using PyPDF2 and langchain.

Text Chunking: Breaks the extracted text into smaller chunks for efficient processing.

Embedding: Uses Hugging Face embeddings to convert text into vector representations.

FAISS: Uses FAISS vector store for similarity search to retrieve relevant chunks for summarization.

OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo: Summarizes the text using OpenAI's language model, specifically designed for longer contexts with up to 16k tokens.

Requirements
Python 3.x

Install required Python packages via pip:

bash
Copy
Edit
pip install langchain openai faiss-cpu PyPDF2 sentence-transformers
An OpenAI API Key for accessing OpenAI's GPT-3.5 model. (Ensure to save this in a separate api_key.py file for security.)

Setup
Clone the Repository:

bash
Copy
Edit
git clone https://github.com/yuviim/PDF-Summarization.git
cd PDF-Summarization
API Key Setup: Create a file named api_key.py in the root directory of the project, and paste your OpenAI API key inside it:

python
Copy
Edit
api_key = 'your-openai-api-key-here'
Run the PDF Summarizer: To summarize a PDF, simply pass the path of the PDF to the summarizer() function:

python
Copy
Edit
from summarizer import summarizer

pdf_path = 'path_to_your_pdf.pdf'
summary = summarizer(pdf_path)
print(summary)
How It Works
Text Extraction: The PDF text is extracted using PyPDF2 and cleaned up for further processing.

Text Splitting: The extracted text is split into smaller chunks (up to 1000 characters each) using CharacterTextSplitter to ensure the text fits within OpenAI’s token limits.

Embeddings: The chunks of text are transformed into vector embeddings using the HuggingFaceEmbeddings model from sentence-transformers.

Similarity Search: The FAISS vector store is used to perform a similarity search on the embeddings, retrieving relevant chunks of text.

Summarization: Using OpenAI GPT-3.5 Turbo, a summary is generated by querying the model with the selected chunks of text.

Example Usage
python
Copy
Edit
from summarizer import summarizer

# Specify your PDF file path here
pdf_file = 'example.pdf'

# Call the summarizer function
summary = summarizer(pdf_file)

# Output the summary
print("Summary of the PDF:")
print(summary)
Notes
The PDF extraction process may not work perfectly on scanned images or PDFs with embedded images. It is designed to work with text-based PDFs.

The OpenAI API key should be kept private and not committed to version control (ensure it’s excluded using .gitignore).
